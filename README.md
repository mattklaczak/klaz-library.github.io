<h3>About project 3:</h3>
No known bugs or defects.</p>

<h3>Basic instructions:</h3>
<p>I did not use any special software, just Sublime Text.</p>

<h3>I included a few extra features such as:</h3>
    <ul><li>I customized and updated the appearance of the website</li>
    <li>A search page that allows a patron/librarian to search the library for books based on three aspects:
    	<ol><li>Book title (search items must match entire word the title). For instance, "terminator" will match "robocop vs. terminator" but "robo" would not match. That option is available in the keyword search.</li>
    		<li>Book author. Functions the same as title, but for parts of the author's name</li>
    		<li>Keyword. Uses a regex function to search for any partial match anywhere within the book title/author.</li></ol>
        <li>Extra properties to the User model. Now, the time the user was created in the system is stored as well as the last log-in. This is viewable within the individual user's page but also able to sorted according to longest/shortest account in the system and also most recent log-in/least recent log-in (see below about order by page).</li>
        <li>Added an order by feature in the /accounts/ page. The user can now sort the list of accounts 8 different ways:</li>
        <ol><li>By username ascending/descending</li>
        <li>By e-mail ascending/descending</li>
        <li>By longest/shortest time in the system according to date of time when registered</li>
        <li>By most recent/least recent log-in time which is updated whenever a user signs in.</li></ul>
